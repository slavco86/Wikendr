          <p id="intro-paragraph">Have you ever had a feeling, when you wake up on a Saturday morning, weather is beautiful and you can just see yourself hiking up that trail with your good mates, having a lough and enjoying the scenery? You reach out to your friends, but unfortunately everyone is busy this weekend. Family, kids, household commitments, etc. Or maybe you moved to a new city, and you just don’t have this kind of a social circle yet, but you don’t want to sacrifice your passions and interests in the name of circumstances?</p>
          <p>Well, that’s where Wikendr comes in - a place to organise your weekend and meet new people.</p>
            <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#intro-paragraph-expanded" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="intro-paragraph-expanded"><h3 class="text-center">Read More</h3></a>
            <div class="collapse" id="intro-paragraph-expanded"><p>Wikendr allows you to specify you interests, from Bars and Clubs downtown to cycling, hiking and all sorts of leisure activities. Then, based on your chosen dates and your location, Wikendr will search for matching services in your area, taking into account how much time, you want to devote to your leisure any given day. Let’s say you have a whole day free - just select approximate amount of hours, select what you would like to do and pick a date. It’s easy as that! Wikendr will offer you a selection of services in your local area in a commutable distance based on your requirements and you can book activities there and then as well.</p>
            
            <p>But wait. I can do all this on so many other website, can’t I? And what about my friends? Didn’t I wanted to go and enjoy these activities in a company of good friends?<br>Yes, Yes and Yes!!! You certainly did! And this is exactly what makes Wikendr so special. After you have indicated what sort of thing you’re into, Wikendr will display you photos and profiles of other people who are interested in the same sort of activities as yourself. Or who have already booked the same place or experience that you are interested in. Or they simply might be searching for something that is very close to what interests you.</p>
            <p>Wouldn’t it be nice that you can actually meet a new person, that you otherwise might never have met, who you know for a fact - likes something that you like, just as much as you do? All you have to do is swipe the “right” way and indicate of you are interested in a certain person or not? If you have a “match”, Wikendr will open up a chat window for both of you, so that you can get to know each other, just a little bit better, before meeting up in some special place, that you know for a fact - both of you will enjoy, just as much as the other one.<br>
            This is what we mean, by saying “Meet Truly-Like Minded People”. </p>
            
            <p>Ok, so it looks like we have your attention. That’s good! Below you will find a more detailed information on how Wikendr works and what you can expect from us as well as how to Get Your Wikendr Started.</p>

And it helps me to keep fit and healthy. Through Wikendr I have discovered so many amazing hiking places and little old villages dotted around my town. I have like a month worth of Wikendrs planned out and can’t wait for the next one.</p>

          <p id="dating-profile1-txt">I was always fascinated by canoeing, specifically navigating mountain streams. Needless to say, I have never had a chance to actually try it myself. Then I found Wikendr. It turned out there was a beginners school just a little over an hour drive from my home. Most of my friends are married with kids. So it was one of those weekends when it looks like all your friends have much more important stuff to do, then jumping in some crazy adventure with you. I looked this place up and connected with couple of people, who were showing up as going there the same day. They agreed to look after me, since it would be my first time trying to canoe. Tom was obviously one of them. To cut long story short - 10 minutes on the water and I find myself almost drowning underneath this overturned canoe. Apparently Tom jumped into the water and got me from underneath this canoe. And the rest? Well… the rest is history ;)</p>

          <p id="dating-profile2-txt">I have graduated from the state college in California and got offered an opportunity to come and work for this design agency in London. So I did. I knew about Wikendr before I moved across the pond and was pleasantly surprised that it offered the same level of service as in U.S. Even though I am graphic designer by trade I just couldn’t find time to visit some of the famous London galleries. And then I matched with Sarah on Wikendr. I was intrigued by all the posts and reviews she was leaving almost every single weekend from some cool places around the city. When we started chatting and she found out that I am a designer who hasn’t visited any of the galleries, she almost banished me from the island. Needless to say I asked her to be my guide… smooth, I know. But to my surprise she agreed and the date was set. We spent 2 most interesting and inspiring days of my life over the next weekend. The best part of it is… 2 months later and these 2 days keep on coming. I think this might be beginning of something even more special. Thanks Wikendr!n</p>

        <p>Answer is simple - the same reason why world needs happy people. We all heard stories about burned out, depressed, unfulfilled lives that surround us in this world. Sometimes even we might consider ourselves to be among this crowd. Our research found that one of the main reasons people feel so is that they don’t enjoy or happy with how they get to spend little free time that they get from their busy lives. By helping people to discover and find their true passion in life, be it outdoors activities, visiting cultural places or simply having a great time together in the coolest hidden bar or restaurant in town - we are actively doing our part in making a world a better place.
