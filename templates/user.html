              <p id="dating-profile1-txt">I was always fascinated by canoeing, specifically navigating mountain streams. Needless to say, I have never had a chance to actually try it myself. Then I found Wikendr. It turned out there was a beginners school just a little over an hour drive from my home. Most of my friends are married with kids. So it was one of those weekends when it looks like all your friends have much more important stuff to do, then jumping in some crazy adventure with you. I looked this place up and connected with couple of people, who were showing up as going there the same day. They agreed to look after me, since it would be my first time trying to canoe. Tom was obviously one of them. To cut long story short - 10 minutes on the water and I find myself almost drowning underneath this overturned canoe. Apparently Tom jumped into the water and got me from underneath this canoe. And the rest? Well… the rest is history ;)</p>

              <p id="dating-profile2-txt">I have graduated from the state college in California and got offered an opportunity to come and work for this design agency in London. So I did. I knew about Wikendr before I moved across the pond and was pleasantly surprised that it offered the same level of service as in U.S. Even though I am graphic designer by trade I just couldn’t find time to visit some of the famous London galleries. And then I matched with Sarah on Wikendr. I was intrigued by all the posts and reviews she was leaving almost every single weekend from some cool places around the city. When we started chatting and she found out that I am a designer who hasn’t visited any of the galleries, she almost banished me from the island. Needless to say I asked her to be my guide… smooth, I know. But to my surprise she agreed and the date was set. We spent 2 most interesting and inspiring days of my life over the next weekend. The best part of it is… 2 months later and these 2 days keep on coming. I think this might be beginning of something even more special. Thanks Wikendr!n</p>
